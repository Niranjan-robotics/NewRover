How to run: 
go to https://snowboy.kitt.ai/dashboard
Record a voice to specific word.
Then download that as ".pdml"(example Alexa.pdml) file under snowboy folder.

$~/snowboy 
$ sudo python demo.py Alexa.pmdl

	Listening... Press Ctrl+C to exit

	When you see this >say "alexa" or what ever pdml file word your testing
	this should retun a matching success mesage like this
	
	INFO:snowboy:Keyword 1 detected at time: 2019-09-01 21:40:01
	keep saying name until you get success messages.
	ctrl + c to exit

=========== how to create samples like "Alexa.pdml" ? models using mic ==========
$pi@raspberrypi:~/snowboy $ 
>record voice in 3 files (ex: come / go / stop / chappie / etc)
arecord --format=S16_LE --duration=5 --rate=16000 --file-type=wav 1.wav
arecord --format=S16_LE --duration=5 --rate=16000 --file-type=wav 2.wav
arecord --format=S16_LE --duration=5 --rate=16000 --file-type=wav 3.wav

>to listen to sound recorded : use folloinwg command
	aplay --format=S16_LE --rate=16000 1.wav
Now convert sample to model 

$ python training_service.py 1.wav 2.wav 3.wav saved_model.pmdl
6. Before we utilize our new model we should copy it into our Snowboy folder, this will make it easier to use in our 

Python scripts later on in this guide.
To copy the file, we can run the following two commands. The first one will copy the model file the second one will move us into the snowboy directory.
cp saved_model.pmdl ./snowboy/Alex_model.pmdl (change model name unique)
cd snowboy

7. To test out our new model, we will utilize the demo.py script that came with snowboy. This script allows us to specify the model that we want to use.
Just run the following command from your current directory to start up the script.
Make sure you do not run this script as sudo as it will cause issues with reading from the microphone since we set up our .asoundrc configuration file for the piuser.

test model

python demo.py saved_model.pmdl
or 
sudo python demo.py Alexa.pmdl
or 
sudo python demo.py chappie_model.pmdl
